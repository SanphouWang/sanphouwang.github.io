I am a first year MPhil student from [School of Science and Engineering](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), majoring in Computer and Information Technology. My research interests include federated learning, trustworthy AI and domain generalization.

Currently, under the guidance of Prof. [Xiaoying Tang](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/tangxiaoying), I am conducting research on the Federated Domain Generalization Algorithm Based on Feature Alignment and Expansion. In addition, I have collaborated with others on [FL-Bench](https://github.com/KarhouTam/FL-bench), which is a user-friendly federated learning framework designed to facilitate research in personalized federated learning and federated domain generalization.
