I am a second year M. Phil. student from [School of Science and Engineering](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), supervised by Prof. [Xiaoying Tang](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/tangxiaoying). My research interests include federated learning, trustworthy AI and OOD generalization.

Currently, under the guidance of Prof. [Xiaoying Tang](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/tangxiaoying), I am conducting a research on Federated Domain Generalization. Additionally, I am collaborating with Prof. [Carl Yang](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~jyang71/) from Emory University and Prof. [Lifang He](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/faculty/lifang-he) from Lehigh University to develop an algorithm to mitigate the adverse effects of missing modalities in federated scenarios for disease diagnosis.

I have collaborated with JiaHao Tan on [FL-Bench](https://github.com/KarhouTam/FL-bench), which is a user-friendly federated learning framework designed to facilitate research in personalized federated learning and federated domain generalization.
